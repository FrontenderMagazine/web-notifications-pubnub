Notifications are a great way for apps to indicate that they have something to
tell you, for example, that you’ve received a new Twitter message.

The [W3C Web Notifications API][1] allows your web browser to display
notifications as well: it is a great way to engage with your users because these
notifications can be displayed even when the page is not active — note however 
that the page must be opened in a background tab for the notification to be 
triggered. The W3C doesn’t specify how notifications should look, so Opera has 
chosen to use native notifications so that your browser feels completely 
integrated with your operating system.<figure class="figure">

Web Notifications have been supported by Opera since version 25. The article 
[Web Notifications in Opera Developer 25][3] describes the basic use of the API
.

Today, I am going to show you how to use Web Notifications by creating an
interactive multi-user app using PubNub’s realtime data stream JavaScript APIs.

## What is the PubNub Data Stream Network? {#what-is-the-pubnub-data-stream-
network
}

[PubNub][4] is a secure global Data Stream Network that enables developers to
build, scale, and manage realtime functionality for their applications andIoT
devices. It uses a publish/subscribe model, and its APIs are straightforward to 
use. (Full disclosure: I work for PubNub
)<figure class="figure">

## What we’ll be building {#what-well-be-building}

For this article, I made an alternative version of the “Yo” app, which
allows you to send the message “Yo” to your friends. With the[“Oi” web app][6]

Let’s get started!

## Checking for API support {#checking-for-api-support}

The first step is checking if the Web Notifications API is supported by the
user’s browser. This feature detection step is good practice and currently 
needed since[not all browsers support the API][7] yet.

For this exercise, let’s just simply terminate the app when the browser doesn
’t support the API, since this app is useless without notification capability. 
When you’re building a real web app, you should of course try to provide a nice 
fallback for an optimal user experience.

    if (!window.Notification) {
    	alert('Oops, your browser does not support the Web Notifications API!');
    } else {
    	// Go ahead and use the Web Notification API.
    }
    

## Requesting permission {#requesting-permission}

Each browser provides a built-in permission UI for the Web Notification API, so
that you can control which web pages can send you notifications. When your page 
is loaded for the first time, a browser-specific permission dialog is shown to 
the user. After the user has granted permission, your page can send 
notifications, otherwise (denied), it can’t.<figure class="figure">

![][8]</figure>
    Notification.requestPermission(function() {
    	if (Notification.permission === 'granted') {
    		// Now your page can send the user notifications!
    	}
    });
    

Try for yourself and see. You can always reset the permission setting by going
to opera://settings, selecting Websites from the left column, and scrolling down
to the Notifications section.<figure class="figure">

![][9]</figure>
## Connecting users using PubNub Data Stream {#connecting-users-using-pubnub-
data-stream
}

Once the user has granted permission, the next interaction you expect is that
they enter a name in order to get started.

    <input type="text" placeholder="Type your name to start" autofocus>
    

When the user enters a name, then hits the return key (we’re listening for a
keyup event with a`keyCode === 13`), we send the username to the PubNub stream
to register the user.

    document.querySelector('[type="text"]').addEventListener('keyup', function(event) {
    	if (event.keyCode !== 13) return;
    	if (!input.value) return;
    	username = input.value;
    	// Connect PubNub and register the user …
    });
    

This requires your own PubNub API keys, so you need to 
[sign up for a free account][10]. Your publish/subscribe keys are in the 
[Developer’s Admin Dashboard][11].

Then, include the PubNub JavaScript libraries in your HTML.

    <script src="https://cdn.pubnub.com/pubnub.min.js"></script>
    

Now, let’s initialize the PubNub client API environment, with the user’s
username as a uuid (unique identifier). Also, we create a channel called “oi
”.

    var channel = 'oi';
    var pubnub = PUBNUB.init({
    	subscribe_key: 'your_sub_key',
    	publish_key: 'your_pub_key',
    	uuid: username
    });
    

## Populate a list of users using presence detection APIs {#populate-a-list-of-
users-using-presence-detection-apis
}

You can subscribe the channel for the client to the PubNub network to create an
open TCP socket and begin listening for messages.

PubNub also provides “presence detection”, which allows you to check up on
your users’ presence status, for instance, when they come online and when they 
leave. This feature is useful to populate an up-to-date list of every user 
currently subscribed to a channel.

In this demo, we update the DOM with the current list of users you can send “
Oi” messages to, using PubNub’s`here_now` APIs. The following function is
called each time each time a user joins or leaves. (The subscribe API is 
explained later
).

    var updateList = function() {
    	pubnub.here_now({
    		channel: channel,
    		callback: function(m) {
    			// get current users and update DOM
    		}
    	});
    };
    

To make this article simple and focus more on the essential parts, I’m
skipping the details of presence detection, but you can always take a look at 
the[source code][12] to see how it is done!

## Sending messages {#sending-messages}

When the user clicks a username in the list, the app will publish a message.
The publish() function is used to send a message to all subscribers of a channel.
You can simply pass an object as a message payload. In this demo, only from and 
to info is passed but you can send any messages in the object.

    var list = document.querySelector('.list');
    list.addEventListener('click', function(event) {
    	if (!event.target.id) return;
    	pubnub.publish({
    		channel: channel,
    		message: {
    			from: username,
    			to: event.target.id
    		}
    	});
    });
    

You can pass an object with any data you want as the message. So instead of the
default “Oi!” message, you can also modify the script and allow your users to 
send custom messages.

## Receiving messages {#receiving-messages}

When somebody sends the user a message, the web app will trigger the browser to
display a notification.

To make to this demo very simple, rather than establishing a 1-to-1 private
connection, we let our web app broadcast messages to all users simultaneously. 
However, only a designated person will receive a web notification.<figure class
="figure
">

![][13]</figure>
To retrieve the live messages, you simply use PubNub subscribe() API. If the
message is sent to a particular user, that user will see a notification.

    pubnub.subscribe({
    	channel: channel,
    	callback: function(message) {
    		if (message.to === username) {
    			showNotification(message);
    		}
    	}
    });
    

## Displaying a notification {#displaying-a-notification}

Creating a web notification is super-simple: just call the Notification
constructor.

    var notification = new Notification(title, options);
    

The title must be a string, and options may contain an object with the
properties:

*   `dir` (direction, can be either `auto`, `ltr`, or `rtl`. Used with
    bidirectional text
    )
*   `lang` (language)
*   `body` (extra text)
*   `tag` (used to coordinate multiple instances)
*   `icon` (the URL of an icon image)

Let’s complete the `showNotification` function. This displays a notification,
and closes it after 30 seconds. If you would like to leave it until the user 
dismisses the popup, just omit the last part.

The tag member is used by each instance to coordinate how many notifications to
show. For example, even if you have the app opened in multiple tabs with the 
same username, you only receive one notification popup when they share the same 
tag.

    function showNotification(data) {
    	var notification = new Notification('Oi!', {
    		body: 'From: ' + data.from,
    		tag: channel,
    		icon: 'images/oi.png'
    	});
    	notification.onshow = function() {
    		setTimeout(notification.close, 30000);
    	};
    }
    <figure class="figure">

![][14]</figure>
Ta-da! Now you can annoy random strangers online by sending them an “Oi!”
message. The entire source code is available on[GitHub][15].

This demo is very basic, and quite frankly, a bit silly, but web notifications
can be really interactive and useful when you use them wisely!
